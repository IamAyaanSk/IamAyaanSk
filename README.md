## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and enhancing applications. You'll often find me crafting innovative solutions and exploring the latest tech trends ðŸš€.

I specialize in writing high-quality code in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I frequently work with frameworks and tools like React, Next.js, Shadcn UI, TanStack and much more. I strive to build software that delivers an intuitive UI and scalable, high-performance architecture.

My skills evolve with every project I tackle. I love solving complex challenges and delivering creative solutions that make a real impact.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me gazing at the stars, swimming, or brainstorming my next big project âœ¨.
